          <p>I have a gigantic erect penis. A good long cylindrical object that can be used to scale my penis is that of the Empire State Building's height. I have suffered many problems logging around my hose of a cock. Yes, you guessed correct, I am Patrick. However, this project was designed by 2 very different men; Amal and I. Of course, my hose cock is there to compensate for the nanoscale penis Amal has. Our goal with this project is to demonstrate the potential of dick fusion where we take the penises of two men, one long and one short, and fuse them together to form a sufficiently large penis - 35 lightyears.</p>
